##Eccentric WiFi: Networks of others.

_Media are not only devices of information; they are also agencies of order._  
_John Durham Peters, 2015_

 
Technologies are dynamic agents that coproduce our environments and social structures through material, psychological and (more recently) algorithmic interactions. It is inevitable that they embody the agendas and priorities of their makers. Yet if we are to adequately address urgent contemporary challenges like environmental destabilization and global inequality, both of which are tightly bound to trajectories of technological development, it is imperative we re-conceive our technical systems and infrastructures to address the needs and agendas of those whose livelihoods currently exist outside of their scope. I call work that takes up this challenge – eccentric engineering. Eccentric engineering sees experimental systems built with atypical design agendas to foster intimate connections with humans and non-humans societies. It approaches infrastructure not as a service but as a negotiation and attempts to privilege empathy over efficiency, co-dependence over independence and intimacy over autonomy. 

The _Radiotropism_ project applies an eccentric design approach to network technologies. As our lives become increasingly networked, we have developed a profound sensitivity to wireless topographies. We are radiotropic – we carefully prepare for the quiet zone of the subway and adjust our behaviors in response to subtle fluctuations in wireless signal strengths. The _Radiotropism_ project probes this sensitivity, leveraging it in different ways. The work consists of a series of experimental WiFi routers that attempt to tie their user's network experience to natural phenomena in novel ways. This project serves as an example of creative work that acts not only at an informational level, but at the level of infrastructure itself.
