##Eccentric WiFi: Networks of others.

_Media are not only devices of information; they are also agencies of order._  
_John Durham Peters, 2015_

 
Technologies are dynamic agents that coproduce our environments and social structures through material, psychological and (more recently) algorithmic interactions. Inevitably, they privilege the agendas and priorities of their makers. If we are to adequately address profound contemporary challenges like global inequality and environmental destabilization, both of which are tightly bound to trajectories of technological development, it is imperative we re-conceive our technical systems and infrastructures to address the needs and agendas of those whose livelihoods currently exist outside of their scope. I call work that takes up this challenge – eccentric engineering. These are experimental systems built with atypical design agendas that build intimate connections with humans and non-humans societies. Eccentric engineering approaches infrastructures not as services but as negotiations, it attempts to privilege empathy over efficiency, co-dependence over independence and intimacy over autonomy. 

The _Radiotropism_ project applies this eccentric design approach in the context of network technologies. As our lives become increasingly networked, we are developing a profound sensitivity to wireless topographies. We are radiotropic –carefully preparing for the quiet zone of the subway commute and adjusting our behaviors in response to subtle fluctuations in wireless signal strengths. The _Radiotropism_ project probes this sensitivity, leveraging it in different ways. The work consists of a series of experimental wifi routers that attempt to connect their users with natural phenomena in new ways. In doing so, this project serves as an example of creative work that acts not only at an informational level, but at the level of infrastructure itself.
