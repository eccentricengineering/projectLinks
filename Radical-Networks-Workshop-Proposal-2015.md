###Exploring Radiotropism

####radiotropism: 
_â€“ An innate tendency to react in a definite manner to some form of radiation; broadly :  a natural inclination where radiation is the orientating factor:_

Radiotropism describes a responsiveness to radiation. It is a term that was originally used to describe several fungai species able to source energy from gamma ray emissions at nuclear reactors sites such as Chernobyl. As humans, we are yet to be so talented and we remain unable to meet any energy needs from the low level radiation that makes up our wireless communications networks. However, like these fungai species we have nevertheless developed an particular sensitivity to wireless radio signals and network topographies. 

This workshop explores possibilities for experimental radiotropic interaction and overviews practical opportunities for artistic intervention within domestic network technologies. We will review techniques and strategies for creating wireless access points that behave in unexpected and unconventional ways. Participants will step through the basics of programming a small light weight domestic router running OpenWRT. They will then configure their access point to read serial receive data from a microcontroller such as an Arduino. This configuration enable a domestic wireless network to be responsive to environmental data and sensor reading. Basic scripting will be done in the Python programming language.

## Length of talk / panel / workshop
1.5-2 hours

## Workshop technical requirements and materials list
*Tbmax router (~$27 each)[http://www.amazon.com/Smallest-Router-Wireless-Support-Mobile/dp/B00PNJRDT4] 
*an Arduino (I can provide Arduinos for use in the workshop if required)
*Hookup wire
*Ethernet cable

Ideally each person will be able to connect their router to a modem via an ethernet cable for testing a setup.
Some basic programming experience experience is recommended.

## Demo installation requirements
[For demos, include installation requirements. Please note that most we can provide is table space, power, and network connectivity. Pieces cannot be mounted on walls or ceiling. Demos must be installed both days 10/24 and 10/25 and be attended to. We are not responsible for damages done to your work! (Although we will take every precaution we can to safely handle your work.)]

Tega Brain is an artist and environmental engineer whose work explores the technologies, interfaces, and institutions which shape our relationship with environment systems. 

She creates site specific installations, dysfunctional devices, experimental infrastructures and information systems. She teaches at the School for Poetic Computation, and is visiting faculty in New Media at SUNY Purchase. She has recently been an artist in residence at the Environmental Health Clinic, NYU and in 2013, was awarded an early career fellowship from the Australia Council for the Arts.

My work is a form of eccentric engineering and it reimagines quotidian technologies to address their politics. It takes the form of site specific interventions, dysfunctional devices, experimental infrastructures and information representations (sometimes using underpants).
