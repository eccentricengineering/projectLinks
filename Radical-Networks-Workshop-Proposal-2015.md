Radical Networks 2015 Workshop Proposal

###Exploring Radiotropism

radiotropism: 
_â€“ An innate tendency to react in a definite manner to some form of radiation; broadly :  a natural inclination where radiation is the orientating factor:_

Radiotropism describes a responsiveness to radiation. It is a term that was originally used to describe several fungai species able to source energy from gamma ray emissions at nuclear reactors sites such as Chernobyl. As humans, we are yet to be so talented and we remain unable to meet any energy needs from the low level radiation that makes up our wireless communications networks. However, like these fungai species we have nevertheless developed an particular sensitivity to wireless radio signals and network topographies. 

This workshop explores possibilities for experimental radiotropic interaction and overviews practical opportunities for artistic intervention within domestic network technologies. We will review techniques and strategies for creating wireless access points that behave in unexpected and unconventional ways. Participants will step through the basics of programming a small light weight domestic router running OpenWRT. They will then configure their access point to read serial receive data from a microcontroller such as an Arduino. This configuration enable a domestic wireless network to be responsive to environmental data and sensor reading. Basic scripting will be done in the Python programming language.

**Duration:** 2hrs

**Equipment Requirements:**

Each participant will require 
Tbmax router (~$27 each) 
an Arduino (I can provide Arduinos for use in the workshop if required)

Group will require access to a soldering station to carry out simple soldering.
Ideally each person will be able to connect their router to a modem via an ethernet cable for testing a setup.
Some basic programming experience experience is recommended.

**Group size:** 5-8
