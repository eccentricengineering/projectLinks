## Description of your workshop 

_radiotropism:_
_â€“ An innate tendency to react in a definite manner to some form of radiation; broadly :  a natural inclination where radiation is the orientating factor:_

Radiotropism describes a responsiveness to radiation. It is a term that was originally used to describe several fungai species able to source energy from gamma ray emissions at nuclear reactors sites such as Chernobyl. As humans, we are yet to be so talented to be able to meet any energy needs from the low level radiation of our wireless communications networks, however, like these fungai species we have nevertheless developed behavioural sensitivities to wireless radio signals and network topographies. 

This workshop explores our radiotropic interactions and overviews artistic opportunities for network interventions using domestic wireless technologies. We will consider some techniques and strategies for creating wireless access points that behave in unexpected and unconventional ways. Participants will step through the basics of programming a small light weight domestic router running OpenWRT. We will setup the router as a wireless access point and to read serial receive data from a companion device. Participants will be able to create wireless networks that are responsive to environmental inputs. Basic scripting will be done in the Python programming language.

## Length of talk / panel / workshop
1.5-2 hours

## Workshop technical requirements and materials list
Equipment:  
*Tbmax router (~$27 each)[http://www.amazon.com/Smallest-Router-Wireless-Support-Mobile/dp/B00PNJRDT4]   
*an Arduino board (I can provide Arduinos for use in the workshop if required)  
*A sensor  
*Hookup wire  
*Ethernet cable  
  
Ideally each person will be able to connect their router to a modem via ethernet for testing a setup.
Some basic programming experience experience is recommended.
**Group size:** Probably 5-8

Tega Brain is an artist and environmental engineer working at intersection of art, engineering and ecology. She makes eccentric engineering, reimagining quotidian technologies to address their politics. Her work takes the form of site specific interventions, dysfunctional devices, experimental infrastructures and information representations. She is currently a resident at Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology, she also does things at the School for Poetic Computation, and is full-time faculty at SUNY Purchase. In 2013, was awarded an early career fellowship from the Australia Council for the Arts.
